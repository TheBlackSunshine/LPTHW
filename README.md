This repo is a collection of the exercises in each chapter of the book "Learn Python the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw.

I read the third edition of the book, covering Python 2.7.

The "exercises" mostly just typing code from the book (Zed makes it very clear there is to be no copying and pasting...) and running it, although some require the odd modification.

I completed the book and overall I'd say it's a pretty good introduction to Python, although his aversion to Python 3 lets him down (I believe he has corrected this in a 2017 fourth edition). I supplemented it with the Python Codecademy course.
